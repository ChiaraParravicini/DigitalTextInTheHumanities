        Author's Introduction
After considering the historic page, and viewing the
living world with anxious solicitude, the most melan-
choly emotions of sorrowful indignation have depressed
my spirits, and I have sighed when obliged to confess
that either Nature has made a great difference between
man and man, or that the civilization which has hitherto
taken place in the world has been very partial. I have
turned over various books written on the subject of
education, and patiently observed the conduct of parents
and the management of <span type="education">schools</span>; but what has been
the result? - a profound conviction that the <span type="education">neglected
education</span> of my fellow-creatures is the grand source of
the misery I deplore, and that women, in particular, are
rendered weak and wretched by a variety of concurring
causes, originating from one hasty conclusion. The con-
duct and manners of women, in fact, evidently prove
that their minds are not in a healthy state; for, like the
flowers which are planted in too rich a soil, strength and
usefulness are sacrificed to <span type="beauty">beauty</span>; and the flaunting
leaves, after having pleased a fastidious eye, fade, disre-
garded on the stalk, long before the season when they
ought to have arrived at maturity. One cause of this
barren blooming I attribute to a false system of edu-
cation, gathered from the books written on this subject
by men who, considering females rather as women than
I
Mary Wollstonecraft
human creatures, have been more anxious to make them
alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational
mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been
so bubbled by this specious homage, that the civilized
women of the present century, with a few exceptions,
are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to
cherish a nobler ambition, and by their abilities and
virtues exact respect.
In a treatise, therefore, on female rights and manners,
the works which have been particularly written for their
improvement must not be overlooked, especially when
it is asserted, in direct terms, that the minds of women
are enfeebled by false refinement; that the books of
instruction, written by men of genius, have had the same
tendency as more frivolous productions; and that, in the
true style of Mahometanism, they are treated as a kind
of subordinate beings, and not as a part of the human
species, when improvable reason is allowed to be the
dignified distinction which raises men above the brute
creation, and puts a natural sceptre in a feeble hand.
Yet, because I am a woman, I would not lead my
readers to suppose that I mean violently to agitate the
contested question respecting the quality or inferiority
of the sex; but as the subject lies in my way, and I cannot
pass it over without subjecting the main tendency of my
reasoning to misconstruction, I shall stop a moment to
deliver, in a few words, my opinion. In the government
of the physical world it is observable that the female in
point of strength is, in general, inferior to the male. This
is the law of Nature; and it does not appear to be
suspended or abrogated in favour of woman. A degree
2
A Vindication of the Rights of Woman
of physical superiority cannot, therefore, be denied, and
it is a noble prerogative! But not content with this natural
pre-eminence, men endeavour to sink us still lower,
merely to render us alluring objects for a moment; and
women, intoxicated by the adoration which men, under
the influence of their senses, pay them, do not seek to
obtain a durable interest in their hearts, or to become
the friends of the fellow-creatures who find amusement
in their society.
I am aware of an obvious inference. From every
quarter have I heard exclamations against masculine
women, but where are they to be found? If by this
appellation men mean to inveigh against their ardour in
hunting, shooting, and gaming, I shall most cordially
join in the cry; but if it be against the imitation of manly
virtues, or, more properly speaking, the attainment of
those talents and virtues, the exercise of which ennobles
the human character, and which raises females in the
scale of animal being, when they are comprehensively
termed mankind, all those who view them with a philo-
sophic eye must, I should think, wish with me, that they
may every day grow more and more masculine.
This discussion naturally divides the subject. I shall
first consider women in the grand light of human crea-
tures, who, in common with men, are placed on this
earth to unfold their faculties; and afterwards I shall
more particularly point out their peculiar designation.
I wish also to steer clear of an error which many
respectable writers have fallen into; for the instruction
which has hitherto been addressed to women, has rather
been applicable to ladies, if the little indirect advice that
3
Mary Wollstonecraft
is scattered through 'Sandford and Merton' be excepted;
but, addressing my sex in a firmer tone, I pay particular
attention to those in the middle class, because they
appear to be in the most natural state. Perhaps the seeds
of false refinement, immorality, and vanity, have ever
been shed by the great. Weak, artificial beings, raised
above the common wants and affections of their race, in
a premature unnatural manner, undermine the very
foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the
whole mass of society! As a class of mankind they have
the strongest claim to pity; the education of the rich
tends to render them vain and helpless, and the unfolding
mind is not strengthened by the practice of those duties
which dignify the human character. They only live to
amuse themselves, and by the same law which in Nature
invariably produces certain effects, they soon only afford
barren amusement.
But as I purpose taking a separate view of the different
ranks of society, and of the moral character of women
in each, this hint is for the present sufficient; and I have
only alluded to the subject because it appears to me to
be the very essence of an introduction to give a cursory
account of the contents of the work it introduces.
My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if 1 treat them like
rational creatures, instead of flattering their fascinating
graces, and viewing them as if they were in a state of
perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone. I earnestly
wish to point out in what true dignity and human happi-
ness consists. I wish to persuade women to endeavour
to acquire strength, both of mind and body, and to
convince them that the soft; phrases, susceptibility of
4

heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are
almost synonymous with epithets of weakness, and that
those beings who are only the objects of pity, and that
kind of love which has been termed its sister, will soon
become objects of contempt.
Dismissing, then, those pretty feminine phrases,
which the men condescendingly use to soften our slavish
dependence, and despising that weak elegancy of mind,
exquisite sensibility, and sweet docility of manners, sup-
posed to be the sexual characteristics of the weaker
vessel, I wish to show that elegance is inferior to virtue,
that the first object of laudable ambition is to obtain a
character as a human being, regardless of the distinction
of sex, and that secondary views should be brought to
this simple touchstone.
This is a rough sketch of my plan; and should I express
my conviction with the energetic emotions that I feel
whenever I think of the subject, the dictates of experience
and reflection will be felt by some of my readers. Ani-
mated by this important object, I shall disdain to cull my
phrases or polish my style. I aim at being useful, and
sincerity will render me unaffected; for wishing rather
to persuade by the force of my arguments than dazzle
by the elegance of my language, I shall not waste my
time in rounding periods, or in fabricating the turgid
bombast of artificial feelings, which, coming from the
head, never reach the heart. I shall be employed about
things, not words! and, anxious to render my sex more
respectable members of society, I shall try to avoid that
flowery diction which has slided from essays into novels,
and from novels into familiar letters and conversations.

These pretty superlatives, dropping glibly from the
tongue, vitiate the taste, and create a kind of sickly deli-
cacy that turns away from simple unadorned truth; and
a deluge of false sentiments and overstretched feelings,
stifling the natural emotions of the heart, render the
domestic pleasures insipid, that ought to sweeten the
exercise of those severe duties, which educate a rational
and immortal being for a nobler field of action.
The education of women has of late been more
attended to than formerly; yet they are still reckoned a
frivolous sex, and ridiculed or pitied by the writers who
endeavour by satire or instruction to improve them. It
is acknowledged that they spend many of the first years of
their lives in acquiring a smattering of accomplishments;
meanwhile strength of body and mind are sacrificed to
libertine notions of beauty, to the desire of establishing
themselves - the only way women can rise in the world
- by marriage. And this desire making mere animals of
them, when they marry they act as such children may
be expected to act - they dress, they paint, and nickname
God's creatures. Surely these weak beings are only fit
for a seraglio! Can they be expected to govern a family
with judgement, or take care of the poor babes whom
they bring into the world?
If, then, it can be fairly deduced from the present
conduct of the sex, from the prevalent fondness for
pleasure which takes place of ambition and those nobler
passions that open and enlarge the soul, that the instruc-
tion which women have hitherto received has only
tended, with the constitution of civil society, to render
them insignificant objects of desire - mere propagators
6

of fools! - if it can be proved that in aiming to accomplish
them, without cultivating their understandings, they are
taken out of their sphere of duties, and made ridiculous
and useless when the short-lived bloom of beauty is
over, I presume that rational men will excuse me for
endeavouring to persuade them to become more mascu-
line and respectable.
Indeed the word masculine is only a bugbear; there is
little reason to fear that women will acquire too much
courage or fortitude, for their apparent inferiority with
respect to bodily strength must render them in some
degree dependent on men in the various relations of life;
but why should it be increased by prejudices that give a
sex to virtue, and confound simple truths with sensual
reveries?
Women are, in fact, so much degraded by mistaken
notions of female excellence, that I do not mean to add
a paradox when I assert that this artificial weakness
produces a propensity to tyrannize, and gives birth to
cunning, the natural opponent of strength, which leads
them to play off those contemptible infantine airs that
undermine esteem even whilst they excite desire. Let
men become more chaste and modest, and if women do
not grow wiser in the same ratio it will be clear that they
have weaker understandings. It seems scarcely necessary
to say that I now speak of the sex in general. Many indi-
viduals have more sense than their male relatives; and, as
nothing preponderates where there is a constant struggle
for an equilibrium without it has naturally more gravity,
some women govern their husbands without degrading
themselves, because intellect will always govern.
