              The prototype of an archive of women authors
            </p>
            <p>
              "Words of Gender" takes inspiration from the essay Parole d'altro genere (Rizzoli, 2023) by sociolinguist Vera Gheno, in which she selects 42 female authors who have contributed to women's emancipation throughout history. From Gheno we borrow the idea of examining how different female authors in different historical and cultural contexts have written about the same concepts, sometimes elaborated in depth as the main theme and sometimes only mentioned as an input for a broader argument. The aim of this research is to identify these concepts, both explicit and implicit, to highlight the conceptual connections that unite the selected literary texts, constructing a network of variations and cross-references.</p>
              <p>
              Therefore, having as our first reference the excerpts selected by Gheno in Parole d'altro genere, we choose to extrapolate some of them with the intention of linking them with each other and defining maps of meaning to build an intertextual dimension. Intertextuality is not intended as a simple relationship between one text and another, but as a “pantextualistic vision in which the world itself becomes a text, an infinitely ramified labyrinth of texts that recall and intertwine, without any possibility of arriving at an unambiguous, stable and delimited meaning”.</p>
              <p>
                There is a general lack of awareness regarding female authors. Indeed, a study published by <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239012">PLOS</a> reports that "emerging evidence demonstrates that female-authored publications are not well represented in course readings in some fields, resulting in a syllabi gender gap." This is why <b>women</b> are the center of this digital archive and antology, whose aim is to keep expanding.

                  <b>Our reserch question: </b>How have different authors declined the same concepts related to the female gender (e.g. grace, beauty, maternity ...) in different historical and cultural contexts?
                </p>

                <p>
                  The research fits into the context of gender studies, as it shares some of its characteristic intentions. Firstly, following the example of Vera Gheno, the project aims to give a voice to female authors who have been neglected over time and excluded from the literary canon. Furthermore, the creation of links between concepts belonging to different semantic spheres makes it clear that gender issues are inseparable from those of class, religion, origin and many others. Finally, the direct comparison of different ways of interpreting the same fundamental concepts (gender, beauty, femininity) brings out how these are not unambiguous and unchangeable, but rather changeable and closely dependent on the society in which they develop.                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another field of study within which this research is inscribed is that of comparative literature, since it broadens the analysis of certain key concepts beyond country and class boundaries. In an initial phase of the project we will adopt a perspective that is still West-centric, but in a further development of this research we hope that authors with different ethnic backgrounds will be included too in order to enrich this digital archive.  
                </p>
              <h4>What happened to female writers?</h4>
                <p>
                  The landscape of digital archives leaves little room for female authors. In the Italian context, even big projects like the <a href="http://www.bibliotecaitaliana.it/">Biblioteca italiana</a> out of a collection of more than 180 volumes, fewer than ten are works written by women. As the writer and sociolinguist Vera Gheno effectively highlights in Parole d’altro genere, even in school anthologies, which are the first to contribute to the normalization of a canon, women are absent or severely underrepresented:
                  <blockquote>
                    Some might argue, I can already hear the objections, that the reason for the absence of female authors in the so-called literary canon is that the ones that do exist are less brilliant, of lower quality, and therefore, in a merit-based selection, their numbers are reduced. Yet, this does not correspond to reality: when one looks more closely, discovers an immense, highly valid production that mostly remains below the surface: the famous women's literature, written by women, read by women, defined as 'genre fiction' (just as if "male" is not a genre in itself)<sup><a id="fn1" href="#footnotes">[1]</a></sup>.
                  </blockquote>
                  The initial issue of representation morphs into a misconception centered on quality and merit, resulting in a cultural hegemony that does not allow room for expression and does not guarantee freedom of speech. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our work, therefore, begins with the recognition of a gap and the awareness that the "cogency of female literary culture as a whole lies in the multiplicity of its voices and its insistence upon the collective foundation of individual consciousness" <sup><a id="fn2" href="#footnotes">[2]</a></sup>. It is necessary to recognize that literature, rather than being punctuated by a few highly successful women, is instead rich in female authors. This forgotten literature must be considered an essential, yet forgotten, part of our culture and experience, which is therefore characterized by multiplicity and exchange but also by conflict and tragedy.

                  Over the years, awareness of this representational gap and its cultural, political, and male-oriented origins has grown. Numerous projects have emerged with the aim of addressing this gap or bringing it to the attention of the public.

Instead, it arose from the gap in The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, which included writers considered canonical but excluded those who had later become part of anthologies.

                <h4>Vera Gheno: a female writer for female writers</h4>
                <p>
                  Vera Gheno's novel, <i>Parole d’altro genere</i> (as we have already mentioned), presents itself as an attempt to a feminist reappropriation. It is a collection of authoritative texts, an anthology, and a female canon. What is being claimed is what has been taken from women for a long time: the space of the book page and in general the right to speech. For a long time, words did not belong to women, and often what is perhaps the most important and personal among words was taken from them: their own name. Often, female authors have been forced to use pseudonyms, and their names have been condemned to silence. But there are also other mechanisms that have taken words away from women. An example is discursive injustice. Or the tendency to use rhetorical weapons to make the text acceptable in contexts where a woman was not free to say everything she wanted. This is where Vera Gheno's reflection begins:
                  <blockquote>
                    I have had the privilege of adding my voice to these exceptional authors: for each of them, I have selected a word, or it would be better to say a lemma (a noun, an adjective, a verb) that has a special connection with the texts or the life of that author, and I have built a brief argument around it: Disobedience for Chiara D'Assisi, Whore for Marguerite d'Angoulême, Erase for Alfonsina Storni, Divorce for Zhang Ailing...<sup><a id="fn4" href="#footnotes2">[4]</a></sup>

                <h4>Words of gender- the digital archive</h4>
                <p>Taking inspiration from these and similar projects, we have decided to build a philological archive for gender studies. The key elements of our idea are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i><b>Archive</b> A freely accessible archive of texts written by women. Having an archive of texts is essential, especially for their preservation. As Willett Perry from the Victorian Women Writers Project emphasizes:
                    <p>
                    <blockquote>The breadth of writing by women in this period seems staggering, and much of it was either printed in limited press runs, not collected by libraries, or has disintegrated along with so many other works from the late nineteenth century (many of which were printed on acid-based paper). Carol Poster writes of the urgency of recovering these works, noting that failure to do so "will be the permanent silencing of the majority of popular female Victorian novelists by permitting physical disintegration of their works."<sup><a id="fn5" href="#footnotes3">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>
                  <blockquote>As literary critics rediscover women's writing from this period, the immediate hurdle they must overcome is finding works by these writers. A recent discussion on the victorian list demonstrated researchers' frustrations with the limited in-print availability of works by women writers of this period. One professor said that she routinely sends inquiries to publishers as to whether they would be interested in reprinting some of these works, and the answer is invariably "no."</blockquote>
                </p>
                    </li>

                <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>
                  <b>Digital</b> The opportunity provided by the digital medium allows for efficient collection management. Not only it offers an intuitive way to navigate through texts, but it also makes it easy to keep the archive up to date. Digitalization also enables the uploading of texts in standardized XML formats with TEI, making them as accessible as possible. Creating a digital environment is also a good strategy to enable alternative views, such as the one for concepts, which we will discuss in more detail later on.

                <h4>Words and concepts: their role</h4>
                <p>
                  Compared to a typical digital archive, we have chosen to foster a productive dialogue among the texts. From Gheno we borrow the idea of examining how different female authors in different historical and cultural contexts have written about the same concepts, sometimes elaborated in depth as the main theme and sometimes only mentioned as an input for a broader argument. The aim of this research is to identify these concepts, both explicit and implicit, to highlight the conceptual connections that unite the selected literary texts, constructing a network of variations and cross-references.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, having as our first reference the excerpts selected by Gheno in Parole d'altro genere, we choose to extrapolate some of them with the intention of linking them with each other and defining maps of meaning to build an intertextual dimension. Intertextuality is not intended as a simple relationship between one text and another, but as a “pantextualistic vision in which the world itself becomes a text, an infinitely ramified labyrinth of texts that recall and intertwine, without any possibility of arriving at an unambiguous, stable and delimited meaning”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is for this reason that we choose to approach the notion of text as an open, plural, disseminated work, believing that in this way we can achieve the ambition of a collection that articulates horizontally (thus taking into account the temporal axis) and multiplies vertically.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <blockquote>
                    What has become important, then, is not the unity of a text produced by one person – and legitimated by her or him, or by an editor – but the collection of dynamic relationships that this content maintains with other content. And these relationships, which are part of an open process, determine the existence of a piece of content. It is the ensemble of relationships and links that make the content accessible and visible, and thus bring it into existence. Completely independent content would be inaccessible, invisible, actually non-existing.

                <h4>Interoperability and annotations</h4>
                  <p>We decided to create XML versions of texts and use the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) markup. XML is a robust and future-proof format for long-term preservation. It ensures that the encoded texts remain accessible and usable for generations to come, even as technology evolves.
                  TEI is a widely adopted markup XML standard for encoding literary and historical texts. Using TEI helps ensure consistency and compatibility with other digital archives and projects, making it easier to share and exchange data.
                  </p> 
                <p>
                  We then decided to enrich the XML file with Linked Open Data (LOD). 
                </p>
                  <p>
                    <blockquote>
                      The expansion of the Web of Data prompts the redefinition of the concept of digital scientific editions (ESD) by the academic community. ESD, currently structured essentially as a network of documents, must be reconsidered as a set of entities, also resources uniquely identified by URIs and interconnected through the use of typed links (RDF properties), according to a data-centric paradigm. [...] The document (or the collection of documents) that constitutes the edition becomes the subject of a deconstruction process, aimed at identifying uniquely identified informational atoms. However, this process also compels these atomic elements to be extracted, enriched, organized, manipulated, and queried outside the 'straightjacket' of the document within which they occupy a specific position and contribute to its composition.
                    <sup><a id="fn7" href="#footnotes5">[7]</a></sup></blockquote>
                  </p>
                <p>
                  We have reflected on the most suitable schema to use, considering that:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <blockquote>The choice of ontological predicates, suitable for providing real semantic consistency to the markup, must be consciously undertaken with the goal of enhancing the expressiveness of the knowledge base contained in the text, avoiding the dispersion of its informational potential in the name of, albeit necessary, simplification. The selection of the most suitable ontological models constitutes the central aspect of this phase.<sup><a id="fn8" href="#footnotes5">[8]</a></sup></blockquote>
                </p>
                  <p>We decided to use it also because TEI provides a granular approach to annotation, allowing you to add detailed metadata and commentary to texts. This is valuable for scholarly analysis and interpretation and we have made extensive use of the features provided by the &lt;interpGrp&gt; tag. We analysed each text and selected significant segments (see the tags &lt;seg&gt;) that could be topics or concepts also addressed by other authors, allowing us to create a bridge between the texts (following the idea described above).</p>
                  <p>Here there is a full list of the concepts we decided to work with. 
                    <br>
                    <h4>An alphabet of concepts</h4>
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2">
                <h4>Visualisation</h4>
                  <p>To visualise our XML texts we used XSLT. XSLT stands for "Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations" and it is a language used for transforming XML documents into different formats, such as HTML. </p>
                  <p>Building XSLT stylesheet we created templates and rules that dictate how the output should be generated from the source data. These templates have allowed us not only to extract the actual text but also the list of characters that we have annotated in XML(&lt;persName	&gt;) and the segments of the concepts that we have selected and highlighted. This transformed output is displayed in our website.</p>
                  <p>The transformation is such that it allows for the marking and easy display of annotations, so that a JavaScript integration is sufficient to make the content segments stand out and catch the eye of the reader who is interested in visualising them.</p>

              <p>
                <h5>Beauty</h5>
                  <p>This concept has historically been associated with femininity, often placing a strong emphasis on physical appearance as a defining feminine value. The concept of beauty is one of the most frequent in the texts we have analysed, and we have highlighted it even when the woman was lacking this required feature (i.e. the case of "La Petite Fadette" by George Sand)</p>
                <h5>Bitch</h5>
                  <p>The term "bitch" has been traditionally used to derogatorily describe women who assert themselves or challenge traditional gender roles, perpetuating negative stereotypes about feminine assertiveness. Although it is used explicitely only in two of our texts, we have identified other references to the concept of a woman being "too free".</p>
                <h5>Body</h5>
                  <p>The way the body of women should be is deeply ingrained in societal norms, often subjecting women to unrealistic beauty standards and objectification. These standards have historically placed a significant emphasis on women's bodies as a means of defining their worth, perpetuating harmful and restrictive ideals. Many excerpts refer to this concept, either to his conceptual absence (i.e. Chiara d'Assisi) or to necessity of taking extreme care of it as a woman (i.e. George Sand).</p>
                <h5>Counterstereotype</h5>
                  <p>A counterstereotyping refers to the deliberate effort to challenge or subvert prevailing stereotypes, often by presenting individuals or groups in a way that contradicts these stereotypes. None of our texts explicitely refer to the concept of "counterstereotype", but we wanted to highlight the excerpts in which the characters represent a clear contradiction to societal norms.</p>
                <h5>Education</h5>
                  <p>Not only in the past, but also today, women's access to education is often limited, reflecting deeply entrenched gender biases and societal norms. Many societies restrict women's educational opportunities, perpetuating gender inequalities and limiting their personal and professional development. We have selected the excerpts that point out the necessity of an education for women (i.e. Mary Wollstonecraft) and highlight their potential (i.e. Veronica Franco).</p>
                <h5>Feminism</h5>
                  <p>Feminism epresented a powerful movement for women's rights, advocating for equality in various spheres, including suffrage, education, and employment. It challenged deeply entrenched gender discrimination and oppressive norms that marginalized women. In one of our excerpts (i.e. Simone de Beauvoir), the presence of feminism as an alternative for the life of a woman is presented explicitely.</p>
                <h5>Food (abstinence)</h5>
                  <p>Women in various cultures were expected to practice food abstinence during specific periods due to cultural or religious beliefs. The evolution of this conceptualization and the ideal body a woman is required to have bring more women than men to mental health disorders linked to their relationship with their body and its nurture. In the texts we have analysed, the prime example of this is Chiara d'Assisi.</p>
                <h5>Gender</h5>
                  <p>Gender is a complex and multifaceted social construct that encompasses a range of identities beyond the traditional binary of male and female. It influences individuals' roles, expectations, and experiences in society, shaping everything from personal relationships to professional opportunities. The excerpts we have highlighted in these texts point out the explicit difference in the conception of women and men, often recognised by the authors themselves (i.e. Mary Wollstonecraft, Veronica Franco)</p>
                <h5>Grace</h5>
                  <p>Grace, often associated with femininity, has historically been idealized as a quality encompassing elegance, poise, and refined manners. It is something positive that a "real woman" is required to have (i.e. Marguerite de Navarre) and not to disregard (i.e. George Sand).</p>
                <h5>Honour</h5>
                  <p>"Honor" in relation to femininity has varied throughout history and cultures, often entwined with notions of purity and virtue. Traditional concepts of feminine honor have placed an emphasis on modesty and fidelity, reflecting societal expectations. The women that break this code are not considered well, as it is the case of the countess in the text by Marguerite de Navarre.</p>
                <h5>Housework</h5>
                  <p>Housework was (and sometimes still is) largely regarded as an essential duty of femininity, reinforcing traditional gender roles where women were responsible for domestic chores and caregiving. These societal expectations often limit women's opportunities outside the home and contribute to their economic dependence. In one of our excerpt (i.e. Simone de Beauvoir), the relevance of houseworks in the life of a woman in a traditional family is highlighted.</p>
                <h5>Independence</h5>
                  <p>Femininity was (and is) often closely tied to dependency, with societal norms promoting women's reliance on male figures for financial and emotional support, reflecting traditional gender roles that limit their opportunities and self-determination. In our text, we refer to this concept as the ability of women to stand out of this preconception, as it is the case of the countess in the excerpt by Marguerite de Navarre.</p>
                <h5>Intellect</h5>
                  <p>Femininity was (and in some geographical locations still is) often unfairly linked to perceived intellectual limitations, reinforcing gender stereotypes that marginalized women's contributions to academia and intellectual pursuits. Traditional expectations focused on nurturing roles rather than intellectual achievements for women. In these excerpts, we have underlined the spans of texts in which women are self-aware of the strenght of their mind, putting themselves at the same level of men.</p>
                <h5>Marriage</h5>
                  <p>Historically, marriage is portrayed as the primary goal and duty of femininity, with women expected to prioritize their roles as wives and mothers above all else. In these excerpts, we have highlighted the spans of texts in which women challenge this preconception and claim their independence (i.e. Chaira d'Assisi, Mary Wollstonecraft)</p>
                <h5>Modesty</h5>
                  <p>Modesty, decency and shame, in the context of traditional femininity, are virtues highly emphasized, requiring women to conform to strict dress codes and behavioral norms. Women are expected to minimize self-expression to conform to societal standards of modesty. That is what we wanted to highlight with this concept, referred to in the case of the excerpt by Madame de Lambert.</p>
                <h5>Mother</h5>
                  <p>Motherhood, historically, has been held as the ultimate expression of femininity, with women expected to prioritize their roles as caregivers and homemakers above all else. There has been a strong emphasis on the idea that a woman's fulfillment and purpose revolved around her ability to bear and nurture children. In these excerpts, we have pointed out the importance that women have given to the ideal of motherhood, coming to the excellence of this role embodied by Mary mother of Christ (i.e. Chiara d'Assisi).</p>
                <h5>Rights</h5>
                  <p>Throughout history, women have faced significant challenges in securing equal rights, including the right to vote, own property, and access education and employment opportunities. One of our text is an excerpt of "A vindication of the Rights of Women" by Mary Wollstonecraft, which is why we included this concept in the archive we have created.</p>
                <h5>Sensuality</h5>
                  <p>Sensuality, in relation to femininity, encompasses a woman's ability to attract men because of her behavior and physical appereance. It highlights the importance of being able to "give" pleasure as an integral aspects of a woman's traditional identity. In one of our excerpt (i.e. Claude Cahun), sensuality is lived as an obstable by the author.</p>
                <h5>Society</h5>
                  <p>Society is intended as a complex and interconnected web of individuals sharing common norms, values, and institutions, shaping collective behavior and interactions. In our project, we refer to this concept as the relation between women (as individuals or as a group) and society, with its norms and constrictions.</p>
                <h5>Sorority</h5>
                  <p>Sorority, often associated with femininity, represents a collective bond and sisterhood among women, providing support, friendship, and a sense of belonging. It emphasizes the strength and solidarity that can arise from female connections and shared experiences, fostering empowerment and mutual support. We wanted to emphasize this concept by highlighting the ideal of sorority portrayed in the past by authors such as Chiara d'Assisi.</p>
                <h5>Strenght</h5>
                  <p>Femininity has been often associated with perceived physical and mental fragility, perpetuating stereotypes that limited women's recognition of their strength. In our project, we have underlined the self-awareness that women nonetheless had of their own strength, despite societal constructs (i.e. Chiara d'Assisi, Mary Wollstonecraft)</p>
                <h5>Ugliness</h5>
                <p>The notion of "ugliness" in relation to femininity has perpetuated harmful beauty standards, pressuring women to conform to narrow ideals of physical attractiveness. Such standards have often been used to undermine women's self-esteem and reinforce gender inequality. In our excerpts, we refer to the concept of ugliness as something the author does not like about their body (i.e. Claude Cahun)</p>
                <h5>Virginity</h5>
                  <p>Virginity has held immense societal value within the context of femininity, often associated with purity, chastity, modesty, and virtue. In certain geographical contexts, today and in the past, women were (and are)expected to preserve their virginity until marriage, reinforcing strict sexual norms and gender roles. This value has been linked to religious requirements and cosmologies, as it is underlined by Chiara d'Assisi in her "Lettera sul digiuno".</p>
                <h5>War</h5>
                  <p>Femininity is often juxtaposed with the traditional image of women as nurturers and peacemakers, while war is viewed as a masculine endeavor. We have highlighted the excerpts in which this conception is reversed, as explicitely as Veronica Franco did in her "D’ardito cavalier non è prodezza", poem whose title itself refers to the theme of war.</p>
                <h5>Weakness</h5>
                  <p>Femininity has been also often associated with notions of weakness or vulnerability, reflecting societal expectations that women should be delicate and dependent. These stereotypes limited women's opportunities and agency, perpetuating gender inequalities. In the excerpts we selected, we have highlighted the concept of weakness as something inherently feminine (i.e. Mary Wollstonecraft).</p>
                <h5>Witch</h5>
                  <p>In the past, the concept of witches often intersected with femininity, as women who deviated from societal norms or exhibited unconventional behavior were frequently accused of witchcraft. These accusations stemmed from deep-seated fears and prejudices, resulting in certain historical periods in persecution and violence against women. We have pointed out the excerpts in which women are reffered to as withces because they act outside of societal standards (i.e. George Sand)</p>
              </p>

                <p>
                  Possible scenarios related to the development of our project would certainly involve enriching our archive with hundreds of texts, perhaps starting with the search for XML-annotated texts that are reliable and open source. Once again, text selection would focus only on women writers but aspire to encompass as many languages and cultures as possible.
                </p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2">
                <p>                  
                  The texts would be properly annotated to create a rich and comprehensive map. Ideally, an additional visualization mode would be added to create a network of concepts that connect the texts with each other in a more immediate and engaging way.
